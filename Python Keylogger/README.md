# Python Keylogger
Welcome to my keylogger project. The purpose of this project to design a keylogger in python to gain a better understanding on how these attacks work.

## How to use:
### simple_key_logger.py:
1. Before running, make sure you do ```pip install pynput```
2. You can create an text file for it to output to, but that is completely optional since the program will create one.
3. Run the program and be amazed.
4. Once finished, stop the program and open the output file to view results.
